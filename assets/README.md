# Description

This directory contains two main files: 1) `renv.lock` containing necessary meta-data for the R `renv` package to set up the environment/libraries necessary for running the [`exactextractr`](https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr) package that implements zonal statistics and 2) `stats.R` that calls [`exactextractr`](https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr) package after the R environment has been fully set up.
